# aoe2_build
Project that allows to create an AOE2 Build Order.

*To do list*
- There is a problem with the merged cells for the buildings data frame. The age is a merged cell. Need to fix that (I think I need to use the same scraping solution I used for the technology dataframe)
- Check if the building dataframe has the columns as numeric
